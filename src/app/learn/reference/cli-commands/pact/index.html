    <stache-code>skyux pact</stache-code> runs pact tests. Pact is a testing framework that you can use to test a SPA's integration with the services that it consumes. Karma is configured to run any files in the <stache-code>src/app</stache-code> folder with names that end in <stache-code>.pact-spec.ts</stache-code>. The <stache-code>pact</stache-code> command reads the <stache-code>pacts</stache-code> setting in <stache-code>skyuxconfig.json</stache-code> configuration file and then spins up an individual pact server for each provider service based on the config information provided in the <stache-code>pacts</stache-code> config option. It also spins up a pact server for the proxy server. When the SPA consumes a service, we recommend creating pact tests to confirm the integration with the provider. For information about configuration for pact testing and how to write pact tests, see <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/advanced/pact-tests">the pact testing tutorial</a>.
